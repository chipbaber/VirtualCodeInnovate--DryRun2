<h4>About</h4>
<p class="aboutText">
Steve is a member of the Developer Innovation Team which is part of the Cloud Solution Hub's ecosystem.

The Cloud Solution Hubs are hubs of full-stack developers and solution engineers focused on building and innovating with our customers looking to build on the Oracle Cloud.

The Cloud Solution Hubâ€™s mission is to drive two objectives - scale and innovation.

Scale - We plan to scale by embedding our services inside existing processes like ECAL. For example a POC or a Workshop should be standard bread and butter services delivered out of the Hubs and in partnership with field teams.

Innovation - We achieve this objective when we can encourage everyone (field and Hub) to share ideas and solutions that can be developed to drive net-new demand for standalone cloud deals.
